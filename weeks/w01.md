# Session 01


## Intro
* Introduce the course
* Briefly discuss the meaning of "meaning"
* Exemplify an issue in semantics and show how it differs from philosophical analysis.

## Key concepts
* Sentence, statement, proposition
* Situation (SoA) and truth
* Arguments
* Validity -- truth preservation
* Soundness vs. validity
* The issue of implicit premisses and unconscious parts of thought.
* Use vs. mention
* Formal versus non-formal (lexical?) validity
* "Uses" of logic

## Conjunction
* varieties of connectives: `but`, `while`, `(even) though`, `although`, `however`, `nevertheless`, `yet`.
* two-way truth preservation (determinism) of conjunction
* deductive versus conversational implications (`but`, `yet`)
* Pitfalls of conjunction reduction
