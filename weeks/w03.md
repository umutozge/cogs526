# Session 03


## Structural issues

* Tree structure
* Main connective
* Inductive definition
* Scope of connectives
* pq-system:
  * Axioms: Every string of the form `xp-qx-` is a well-formed formula (wff).
  * Rules of production: if `xpyqz` is a wff then so is `xpy-qz-`.

## Truth tables
* Ex.  $G \land \neg (C \land E)$
* For arguments ex. $\neg A \land S, A \therefore \neg S$
