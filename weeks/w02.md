## Negation
* Contradictories versus contraries
* Implicit negation: the case of `only`.
* Symbolization Exercises:
  * `John could not solve the problem, and none of his friends could either.`
  * `Some dogs are not fuzzy.`
  * `Ahmet soruyu okumadan cevapladı.`
  * `Ahmet soruyu okumadan cevaplamadı.`
  * `Ahmet soruyu okumadan cevaplayamaz.`
  * `Ahmet soruyu ancak okumadan cevaplayabilir.`
  * `Ahmetin eve gitmediğini düşünüyorum.`
  * `Ahmetin eve gittiğini düşünmüyorum.`
* The issue of domain restriction:
  * Is the following a valid argument? `I'll do logic without taking tests. So, I am not taking tests`
* Pitfalls of quantification:
  * Symbolize `Some dogs are not fuzzy.`
* Pitfalls of psych/perception verbs:
  * Sym `Harry wants Bill not to leave.`
  * Sym `Harry promises not to come.`
  * Sym `John didn't see Mary leave.`
  * Sym `John saw Mary not leave.`
* Further sym exercises:
  * `John is unhappy about something.`
  * `Many of the boys didn't leave.`
  * `Not many of the boys left.`
  * `Most of the boys didn't leave.`
  * `John doesn't beat his wife because he loves her.`
  * `John doesn't leave school until three o'clock.`
  * `Both John and Bill didin't go.`
  * `John and Bill didin't go.`
