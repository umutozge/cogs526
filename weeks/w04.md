# Session 04

## Disjunction

* `John is not tired or bored` -- is there a second reading?
* Inclusive v. exclusive `or`:
  - `I will drink coffee or tea` does not logically imply `I will not drink both.`
  - Lexical exclusive `or`? Latin has `vel` (inc.) v. `aut` (exc.).
* Pitfalls:
  - Psych verbs:

    `Either Tom wants a cat or Tom wants a dog.`
    `Tom wants a cat or a dog.`


    `Massimo believes that either Milan or Juventus will win the Italian cup.`
    `The president fears that his wife of his daughter will talk to the press.`

  - Other:

    `Either Carrie weighs less than Arlene, or she weighs less than Suzi.`
    `Carrie weighs less than either Arlene or Suzi.`

    Compare to:
    `Carrie weighs less than Arlene and Suzi.`

    `Vegetables or fruits are good for you.`
